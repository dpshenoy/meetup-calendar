# meetup-calendar

This is a simple calendar for use by the planners of Data Science meetup
events held at Veritas Technologies LLC in Roseville MN.

Prior to 2019 November 01, the events were primarily hosted by former
employee [Dinesh Shenoy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dinesh-shenoy/).
It is uncertain whether he will be able to keep this calendar up to date
without access to Veritas' calendar for booking the room.

The listed dates with no presenter are *potentially* available. Our
group's use of the room at Veritas is always subject to being pre-empted
if the room is required for company use.

Also note: Our meetup group shares use of the room with the
[Penguins Unbound] Linux users group. The potentially available dates below
deliberately *exclude* any dates which that group has posted as the date for
their monthly meeting, so that the room will be available to them.

**Note:** This calendar is for planning purposes only. The listing of any
event is *no* guarantee that the event will occur on the date listed. Events
are advertised on the Meetup.com pages linked in "Event Links" column.
If there is no link in that column, then the event is only proposed, not
confirmed.
