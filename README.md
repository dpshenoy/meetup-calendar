# meetup-calendar

This is a simple calendar for use by the planners of Data Science meetup
events held at Veritas Technologies LLC in Roseville MN. The events are
primarily hosted by Dinesh Shenoy, who will keep this calendar updated
periodically as presenters are confirmed. We aim to have 1 - 2 events per
month.

The listed dates with no presenter are *potentially* available. Our use of
the room at Veritas is always subject to being pre-empted if the room is
required for company use.

**Note:** This calendar is for planning purposes only. The listing of any
event is *no* guarantee that the event will occur on the date listed. Events
are advertised on the Meetup.com pages linked in "Event Links" column.
If there is no link in that column, then the event is only proposed, not
confirmed.

Our meetup group shares use of the room with the [Penguins Unbound] Linux
users group. The potentially available dates below deliberately exclude
any dates which that group has posted as the date for their monthly meeting.
